## 1. Define Requirements:

Decide if you want additional features like filtering by date, generating reports, or setting budgets.

- Sketch out the user interface, including input fields, buttons, and the layout for displaying expenses.
Consider the user experience (UX) to ensure the interface is intuitive and easy to use.

## 3. Set Up Your Project:
- Create a new directory for your project.
- Initialize a Git repository (git init) and set up a remote repository on GitHub.
Set up your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
## 4. HTML Structure:
- Write the HTML structure for your expense tracker, including input fields for expense details and a section to display the list of expenses.
- Use semantic HTML tags for better accessibility and SEO.
## 5. CSS Styling:
- Style your expense tracker using CSS to make it visually appealing.
- Ensure your design is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
## 6. JavaScript Functionality:
- Implement JavaScript code to handle user interactions and manage expense data.
- Write functions to add new expenses, delete existing expenses, and update the display.
- Consider using ES6 features like arrow functions and template literals for cleaner code.
## 7. Data Management:
- Decide how you'll store expense data. You can use arrays, objects, or even a database if you want to make your expense tracker more advanced.
- Implement functions to save and retrieve data, possibly using browser storage APIs like localStorage.
